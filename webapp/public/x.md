- timeago rechnet nur eine time differenz aus ... das kÃ¶nnen wir ersetzen 1h
- [x] history and connected react router can be safely removed 10m
- remove subscription related pages/code (pricing, subscriptionpage, ) 1h
- creates uuid in browser for optimisitic state update > change this to not use uuid, we could use useId() or some math.Random string generation instead 1h
- improve eslint, typescript and prettier 3h
- create pipeline and project setup in azure 3h
- package upgrades 4h
  - remove typesafe actions... upgrade to latest redux or probably toolkit will help ? 2d



  2d basic fixes/upgrades/unused code removals OR LESS but not more
  ~2d => redux upgrade to redux toolkit
  OR modernize code base from classes to functions 3-5d (completly remove redux and use useState)
